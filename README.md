### Utilities

The app is connected to the Spotify API. This allows the admins to add new artists, albums, songs, etc. to the database in a simple process, just by searching for them and clicking on "add".

The app is also connected to the ChatGPT API, giving the users the power to discover new music they may like by choosing a selected genre.

### Languages, Tools, and Frameworks

The main languages and frameworks we've used for the development of our app have been: Python, React, JavaScript, JWT, SQL Alchemy, Bootstrap, HTML5, and CSS.

Some tools we've used for testing, design, and organization purposes have been: Postman, Slack, Trello, Figma, and Photoshop.

### Future Updates

In the near future, we would like to add several functionalities to our app:

- Feed Section: It'll give the ability to users to express their thoughts about their favorite artist's last album, comment on their friends' publications, or post a picture they've taken at the last festival they've been.
- Channels: An open forum in a variety of topics where users can give their opinion, interact with each other, and meet new people through them.
- Improvements on AI: Music suggestions personalized for the user, based on the music they already like.
- Store: LPs are back to stay. We'd like to benefit from that and add a store with a broad selection of artists that'll bring back revenue. The process will be simple and will be embedded into the app.
- Playlists: We want to give users the ability to create personalized playlists they can share with their friends to be listened in their favorite music app.
